# Smart Street Light

This mini project will detail our implementation of our smart street light system, which is an advanced kind of street lighting that uses sensors and a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino) to control the illumination. The system is designed to be more energy efficient, economically effective, and ecologically benign than standard street lighting systems.


This project will investigate a potential smart street lighting system intended specifically for illuminating roadways only when necessary. The system is constructed in such a way that the lamps only glow at night and when vehicles and people pass by. In addition, a speed monitoring capability is introduced to the system, which captures and shows a vehicle's speed.
